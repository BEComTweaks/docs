# Who are we?

We are **B**edrock **E**dition **Com**munity **Tweaks**, also known as BEComTweaks.

* Take BedrockTweaks as the popular guy in school.
* BEComTweaks is that nerdy guy who wants the same attention.

Started out as a mini-project back in March, it is now a full-time project aimed to challenge Bedrock Tweaks.

#### What is the difference between BedrockTweaks and BEComTweaks? <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-bedrocktweaks-and-becomtweaks" id="what-is-the-difference-between-bedrocktweaks-and-becomtweaks"></a>

1. More packs!
   * BEComTweaks has 500+ resource packs alone that is available right on our site. These did not have to be in VanillaTweaks and are available for more to know about.
2. Behaviour Packs!
   * BEComTweaks will always leave behaviour packs on! Addons are coming soonâ„¢ as well!
3. Fun features!
  1. A search bar
    - to well... search.
  2. Upload your pack to change selected tweaks and redownload
    - Ocassionally packs can break, so you can just upload it and redownload it, maybe selecting a few more as well.
  3. A simple link that you can copy to send to anyone and autoselect the pack
    - Select your tweaks then copy the url! Now you can send the link anywhere and anyone can get your selected tweaks!
  4. Devtools for debugging
    - There have been cases where you can't download anything [BEComTweaks/resource-packs #38](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/issues/38), so a console log and network tester have been added.
  5. A few weird toggles (1 so far, 2 more planned)
  6. Randomly generated background
    - The blocks used depends on the oage you are on. `resource-packs` uses stone and stone ores, `behaviour-packs` uses deepslate and deepslate ores while `crafting-tweaks` uses the variated oak planks.
  7. OreUI theme everywhere
    - Modern web design sucks, I like the step MCBE's OreUI has taken. The library used is at [NSPC911/oreui-html](https://github.con/NSPC911/oreui-html)
  8. Reduced Motion support
    - I personally love reduced motion.
  9. Documentation
    - You are looking at it right now! The documentation isn't exactly well made, but it should help improve the process of creating a Pull Request
  10. Fully Open-Source
    - When I mean 'Fully Open-Source', I mean it. The frontend is in their respective repositories, along with the build script, while the backend is available at [BEComTweaks/server-backend](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/server-backend). Everything is MIT Licensed, which means you can host a hard-fork of BEComTweaks yourself (if you understand our code comments)
