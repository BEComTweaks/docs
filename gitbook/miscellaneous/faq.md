## FAQ <a href="#faq" id="faq"></a>

**1. When will Addons come back?**

Soonâ„¢

Addons will take a while to be added to [Bedrock Tweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net) as DrAV is making some addon bases and making sure they work in the latest version, 1.21. Currently, [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/behaviour-packs) still have some important addons.

**2. When will X be added? / Why is Y not added yet?**

Refer to Impossible Packs before asking this.

The list will continue to expand as more questions are asked.
