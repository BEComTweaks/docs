# FAQ

1. When will Addons come back?
    
    Soon™
    
    Addons will take a while to be added to [Bedrock Tweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net) as DrAV is making some addon bases and making sure they work in the latest version, 1.21. Currently, [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/behaviour-packs) still have some important addons.

2.  When will X be added? / Why is Y not added yet?

    Refer to [Impossible Packs](https://becomtweaks.github.io/docs/misc/impossible-packs.html) before asking this.
