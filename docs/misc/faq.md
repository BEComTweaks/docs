# FAQ

#### 1. When will Addons come back?
  Soonâ„¢
    
  Addons will take a while to be added to [Bedrock Tweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net) as DrAV is making some addon bases and making sure they work in the latest version, 1.21. Currently, [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/behaviour-packs) still have some important addons.

#### 2.  When will X be added? / Why is Y not added yet?

  Refer to Impossible Packs[^1] before asking this.

The list will continue to expand as more questions are asked.
