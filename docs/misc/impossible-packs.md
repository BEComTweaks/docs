# Impossible Packs
A non-exhaustive page on packs that will **NOT** be added to both BedrockTweaks due to Bedrock issues and DrAV's preferences.<br>Keep in mind that some might be added to BEComTweaks as toned-down versions.

## Resource Packs
#### 1. Bushy Leaves
  There is no way to edit a block's geometry to make it bushy in Vanilla Bedrock. While pre-defined blockshapes can be used, with the closest one being Cactus, it does not match the original aesthetic of Bushy Leaves, hence why it is left out.

#### 2. Visual Cauldron Stages

  Cauldron does not support transparent textures, so just removing the center line doesn't help. Cauldrons do not have any visual changes when adding/removing water/powdered snow.<br>However, Lava Cauldrons do have a seperate Block State, but that misses the entire point of Visual Cauldron Stages.

#### 3. Visual Honey Stages

  This pack is available on [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/resource-packs) in a toned-down way. The Bee Hive and Nest only visually change while full, so any other progress in-between cannot be shown in the pack. This prevents DrAV from adding the pack to BedrockTweaks

#### 4. Visual Noteblock Pitch

  This pack is also available on [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/resource-packs) in a different way. Noteblocks have no change in Block States when switching pitches or instruments, so having it change textures is out of the question. However, [lonelyang](https://github.com/lonelyang) discovered that you can edit the Particle emitted by the Note Block to show the current Pitch of it. Again, DrAV doesn't like the implementation of it and will not add it to Bedrock Tweaks

#### 5. Directional Droppers and Dispensers
  
  This is because of Minecraft Bedrock's issue. Mojang decided to combine both the sideways facing dropper textures and the vertical facing dropper textures into a single block without any blockstates.

  ::: details Let's go technical!
  `blocks.json`
  ```json
  "dropper" : {
    "sound" : "stone",
    "textures" : {
      "down" : "dropper_top",
      "east" : "dropper_front_vertical",
      "north" : "dropper_side",
      "south" : "dropper_front_horizontal",
      "up" : "dropper_top",
      "west" : "dropper_side"
    }
  }
  ```
  Have you noticed the East and South textures?
  ```json
      "down" : "dropper_top",
      "east" : "dropper_front_vertical", // [!code focus]
      "north" : "dropper_side",
      "south" : "dropper_front_horizontal", // [!code focus]
      "up" : "dropper_top",
  ```
  Yeah, Mojang decided to set the Upwards and Downwards facing Dropper textures with East and South. They couldn't bother setting a special blockshape for them, like the hopper. What a party pooper.

#### 6. Most of the 3D Category

  Currently supported 3D Packs are 3D Mace and 3D Sun and Moon. [BEComTweaks](https://becomtweaks.github.io/resource-packs) also has 3D Fungi, but anything else is not possible mainly because Custom Geometry cannot be set for Vanilla Blocks. 3D Fungi itself was made using Azalea's Block Shape.

#### 7. Connected Textures

  Only borderless versions, like Borderless Glass is available, as a block is unable to check whether there is another block of the same type touching it. Shaders could be made, but they aren't officially supported on the main version.

#### 8. Wavy Leaves and Plants

  Either with a flipbook texture or shaders.
  - Shaders<br>
    Not possible as it is not officially supported.[^1]
  - Flipbook Texture<br>
    Very demanding, especially on mobile as it utilises extremely high resolution textures

#### 9. Fullbright/Hardcode Darkness/Warm Glow/Mob Spawn Indicator

  No shader support.[^1]

#### 10. Endless End Rods

  Requires a bit more testing. Theoretically, adding a `"blockshape": "block"` should fix it, but I have not tried it yet. Block Shape is also being deprecated, so DrAV refuses to add deprecated features.

#### 11. Randomly Rotated Sunflowers / Taller Sunflowers

  Custom Geometry can't be set for Vanilla Blocks.

#### 12. Redstone Power Levels

  No shader support.[^1]
  There is a buggy version by dhan on mcpedl which doesn't show directions. [Link â†—](https://mcpedl.com/redstone-signal-indicator-for-mcpe/)

#### 13. Groovy Levers

  Custom Geometry can't be set for Vanilla Blocks.

#### 14. Visual Sapling Growth

  No block states to depend on to change textures.

#### 15. No Beacon Beam

  Beacon Beam doesn't support opacity, so if I put a transparent texture, the beam would just turn black.

#### 16. Old Alex & Steve / Dungeons Alex & Steve

  Minecraft no longer loads Alex and Steve textures from resource packs.

#### 17. Big Dripleaf Stem Fix / Small Dripleaf Stem Fix

  Can't make sure the stem properly use the texture, so it could result in the wrong side having no stems

#### 18. Slime Particle Fix / Proper Break Particles / Don't Eat the Bowl

  Vanilla bug that cannot be fixed. The particles' colors cannot be changed and are hardcoded by default.

#### 19. Iron Bars Fix

  General Issue. Z-Fighting cannot usually be fixed unless the shader is properly set or the cube is above the other cube by the smallest dimensions.
  However, shaders can't be changed[^1] and custom geometry cannot be set.

#### 20. Pixel Consistent Trip Wire

  Custom Geometry can't be set for Vanilla Blocks.

#### 21. Diminshing Tools

  The current durability can be obtained, but the item texture cannot be changed based on the durability. Even if it was able to, there would be a ton of textures, lagging the game a lot.

#### 22. Spinning Skull on Fire Painting

  Minecraft Bedrock has all the painting in a single PNG file of resolution 256x256. There are, at minimum, 12 frames. The resolution would become 256x3072. Yeah.
  
## Crafting Tweaks

None at the moment.

## Behaviour Packs

#### 1. Player Heads

  According to [SquatchHunter](https://github.com/SquatchHunter)
  > We cannot make HTTP requests that SAVE the result as a physical file. 
  >
  > On BDS servers (non-realms), HTTP requests can be made, but the result cannot be saved meaning we cannot make the pack "just work"

#### 2. Off-Hand

  Let's go technical![^2]

  It became impossible after 1.20 when Mojang updated the Beta API system to prevent any changes to the player on the gametick that an event happens. FoxyNoTail's [Offhand Addon](https://foxynotail.com/add-ons/off-hand/) heavily relied on this, as it needed the event to change objects from mainhand to offhand on the same gametick that you are placing the block.

[^1]: Shaders are available in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, but they require third-party software like [ddf816/BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/ddf8196/BetterRenderDragon) or Minecraft Preview for Deferred Rendering[^3], which changes every update

[^2]: You don't have a choice.

[^3]: Never call it a shader.
