# Setting up the local respository

You will need
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - You can also get a GUI Client like [Git GUI](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or complicated ones like [Sourcegit](https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/releases/latest) or [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit)
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Code Editor (recommended)

## Setting up pack repositories

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs
    ```
    > You don't have to clone resource-packs, you could clone behaviour-packs or crafting-tweaks
    
    - cd into the respository's folder
    ```sh
    cd resource-packs
    ```

That's it!
